# Green Hack
## Inspiration
We wanted to do something that is fun to use, an educational mobile app with a gamified component like Duolingo while making the user be more green. We also wanted to inform the user of their car carbon footprint. So in the end, we just merged both idea and made Green Hack
## What it does
Green Hack is website that challenges the user to be more green. The Daily Challenges site will give the user like it say daily challenge. Every time the user accomplish a challenge, their level will go out. by increasing their level, they will have a change to be at the top of the leader board. The Carbon Footprint site is to inform the user the amount Co2/km they are putting into the environment when travelling in a vehicle.
## How we built it
We decided to split the web development in to front-end and back-end because we are a team of two. We used Pycharm as IDE with Node.js and MongoDB
## Challenges we ran into
Even if we had some knowledge working with the Pycharm IDE, it was my first time using Node.js and MongoDB. We ran into some installation problems but is was solved with the help of my teammate. Also, we planned on making this idea into a app but we did not have time to set up all the things needed for a app development. So we chang the idea to a website.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In 24h, we made a fully functioning website with login feature.
## What we learned
We learned how to work with MongoDB and Node.js and implement useful features like login and sessions
## What's next for Green Hack
The main goal will be to set it up as an android and ios app like we originally planned at the start of the project. Afterwards, we should add more features. For example letting the user create their own list of challenges that they want to do.
